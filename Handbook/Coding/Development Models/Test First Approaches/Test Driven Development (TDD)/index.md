# Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test-driven development (TDD), is a test-first development approach, where you write a test before 
you write **just enough** production code to fulfill that test.  

Following are practical guides to TDD, illustrating the combination of test-first approach with 
refactoring in an evolutionary development process.
